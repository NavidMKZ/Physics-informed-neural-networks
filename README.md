## Physics-Informed Neural Network

This repository contains simple Python examples of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs incorporate physical laws, represented by differential equations, directly into the learning process for solving scientific computing problems.



## Features

* **Physics Integration**: Implements governing equations (e.g., differential equations) in the training process.  
* **Simplicity**: Easy-to-follow code suitable for learning and experimentation.  
* **Extensibility**: Can be adapted to solve other physical problems by modifying the equations.


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x  
* NumPy  
* PyTorch  
* Matplotlib for visualization
